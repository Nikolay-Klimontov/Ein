# Ein
Small game engine that wants to be a big RTS game

# By now
This is a simple learning project, don't expect to see a "rocket science". But there a lot of dirty code, TODO's, FIXME's (maybe), bad architecture decisions or it has no architecture at all

# What it can do?
## Rendering
Now you can draw something with
### Forward rendering
The easiest way to draw something
### Deferred shading
Not as easy as the first one. But hey, less light calculations
### PBR
Or some sort of...
### Instanced rendering
When you need a bunch of instances of an object on the screen 

# What next 
There is no limitations or restriction except time and hardware
## Engine
"Even a fence will fly, if you attach a rocket engine to it"
### TODO:
0. HUD/UI
1. Animation (rig-based, may be morphing)
2. Optimization 
3. Audio (WWise? OpenAL? Who knows...)
4. Scripting (Oh boy... I see a lot of refactoring)
5. Optimization (again) 
6. AI
7. Network (Danger: Heavy refactoring)
8. Optimization (yep, again) 
9. Resource versioning
10. ???
11. PROFIT!
12. OpenGL 4

NOTE: Somewhere on this list should be "completely rewrite this shit". But i don't know where it should be.

## Tools
“We had two importers, seventy-five various AI modules, five high powered resource redactors, a scripting module half full of cool stuff, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored console utilities for tasks of any kind...
Not that we needed all that for the game, but once you get locked into a serious game development, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.”
### TODO:
0. TBD
